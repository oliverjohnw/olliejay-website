Welcome, all! I'm John Oliver, a 24 year old who recently graduated, currently located out of La Crosse, WI.  I've decided to maintain a personal website where I will be writing blogs on anything that relates to  data science. Feel free to connect with me at my personal email, or reach out on my Github or Twitter page (links displayed in home page).
