Hello, world! Welcome to my personal data science space. I've decided to contruct a website where I will implement and showcase various data science concepts in the form of a blog. Some of these posts will be dense, and consist of large scale projects. Some of these posts may be quick, showcasing a minor skill or tool. Either way, I figured it would be beneficial to start blogging as I expand my data science toolbox.

At the time of starting this website, I am 24 years old and 3 months removed from graduating at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse with a MS in Applied Statistics and a BS in Statistics. I'm currently interning at U.S. Geological Survey as a data scientist. 

Here's to the start of something new! Let's learn & have some fun.
