Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to my personal data science space. This is website is something new that I wanted to try out to document my learning process as I try to break into the world of data science. I'm envisioning this page as a place where I write blogs about different techniques, languages, etc. Basically, I am just going ot document and apply what I've been learning as I go.

At the time of the start of this page, I am currently 24 years old and am interning at U.S. Geological Survey in La Crosse, WI. I recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin La Crosse with an M.S. in applied statistics. While I have plenty of course knowledge from my collegiate career and professional knowledge from my internship, I'm looking forward to learning and applying new things.

Here's to the start of something new! Let's learn & have some fun.
