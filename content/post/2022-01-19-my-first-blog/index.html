<p>Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to my personal data science space. This website is something new that I wanted to try out to document my learning process as I try to break into the world of data science. I’m envisioning this page as a place where I write blogs about different techniques, languages, etc. Basically, I am just going ot document and apply what I’ve been learning as I go.</p>
<p>At the time of the start of this page, I am currently 24 years old and am interning at U.S. Geological Survey in La Crosse, WI. I recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin La Crosse with an M.S. in applied statistics. While I have plenty of course knowledge from my collegiate career and professional knowledge from my internship, I’m looking forward to learning and applying new things.</p>
<p>Here’s to the start of something new! Let’s learn &amp; have some fun.</p>
